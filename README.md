# TrippyGL
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/TrippyGL)](https://nuget.org/packages/TrippyGL)

A simple and lightweight, yet highly versatile OpenGL graphics library built on top of [Silk.NET](https://github.com/Ultz/Silk.NET/).

TrippyGL is built for .NET 6.0!

Targets OpenGL 3.3 and up.

The TrippyGL.ImageSharp project provides integration with [ImageSharp](https://github.com/SixLabors/ImageSharp) for easy texture loading and saving.

For windowing and input, the [Silk.NET.Windowing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silk.NET.Windowing) and [Silk.NET.Input](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Silk.NET.Input) packages can be used.

## Getting Started
[The wiki](https://github.com/SilkCommunity/TrippyGL/wiki) contains explanatory articles and guides to help you get started! I recommend first reading [Getting Started: Opening a Window](https://github.com/SilkCommunity/TrippyGL/wiki/Getting-Started:-Opening-a-Window). After that, if you're after drawing textures check out [Getting Started: Drawing a Texture](https://github.com/SilkCommunity/TrippyGL/wiki/Getting-Started:-Drawing-a-Texture). Or if you're after drawing triangles, check out [Hello Triangle: The easy way](https://github.com/SilkCommunity/TrippyGL/wiki/Hello-Triangle:-The-easy-way).
